###1. kerberos
With [Kerberos](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acjj), by exchanging time-sensitive tickets, you can make transactions secure without sending passwords in plaintext over the network.

A [keytab](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) is a file containing pairs of Kerberos principals and encrypted keys (these are derived from the Kerberos password). You can use this file to log into Kerberos without being prompted for a password. The most common personal use of keytab files is to allow scripts to authenticate to Kerberos without human interaction, or store a password in a plaintext file.
